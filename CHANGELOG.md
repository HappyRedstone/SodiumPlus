# v2.1.0

Sodium Plus gets an overhaul!

We have added a bunch of performance mods, most of which are heavily inspired by the pack __Fabulously Optimised__.

Sodium Plus has also been updated to 1.19.4, but due to this, we have had to remove some mods due to incompatibilities, so hopefully we will be able to add them back in as they update. The list of those mods is below.

- LazyDFU
- DashLoader
- Wavey Capes
- Logical Zoom __(Replaced with Zoomify)__
- Default Dark Mode
- Roughly Enough Items
- ClickThrough
- Entity View Distance
- Bobby
- Durability Viewer
- Even Better Enchants
- Better Beds
- Mouse Wheelie
- Smooth Boot

Also, @NoSadBeHappy broke Packwiz while working on this update, so the main branch on GitHub is currently broken. When he has time, @RedstoneWizard08 work on disaster relief. 

Edit: Yeah, @NoSadBeHappy is apparently not very good at keyboard things (this is a joke, he's great, don't hate) so I had to fix all the issues. ðŸ˜†

# v1.4.3 LoD

This is a version of v.1.4.1 that uses quilt loader.

# v1.4.2

This is a version of v.1.4.0 that uses quilt loader instead of fabric. Sense quilt is faster, and this is a optimazation pack, I am working on moving to only using quilt. This is the first test. Please report any issues you find to my github issues!

# v1.4.1 LoD

This is a updated version of the LoD release v.1.3.1. This has no mods removed, adds litematica to go with v.1.4.0, and has iris shaders included. Although iris is not supported by distant horisons, it can work, so I have left it in there. Use at your own risk, and your game may break. I have also updated all mods. This is basically v.1.4.0 with Distant Horisons added.

# v1.4.0

This is the first major release for Minecraft 1.19.2. This has all of the mods back in that I removed in previous versions, as compatability problems are solved. I have also added litematica, as this seems to be a useful mod that I only started using recently. I have also updated all mods, and updated fabric launcher.

# v1.3.1

This is a alpha version of Sodium Plus with Distant Horisons mod added. This is a LoD mod which makes it possible to have extremely far render distances without too much extra performance loss.

This version also does not include the iris mod, as shaders are not supported with distant horizons.

# v1.3.0

This is a beta version for Minecraft 1.19.2. I have again removed some mods because of incompadablilties, but hope to add them back in as they get updated. The list of mods removed is below.

- REI (Roughly Enough Items) (and Architectury API)
- Iris shaders
- Xaero's Minimap
- Xaero's World Map

# v1.2.1

This is a minor update for 1.2.0 for Minecraft version 1.19. Includes the 4 mods I removed in Version 1.2.0, and updates all mods.

# v1.2.0

This is the first release for Minecraft 1.19. I have removed 3 mods from this version because they were crashing Minecraft, so therefor this is a beta version and I will upload a new version once those mods update, or I figure out the issue.

The missing mods are:

- Not Enough Crashes (Fabric): https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-crashes
- Drip Sounds (Fabric): https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dripsounds-fabric
- Slyde: https://modrinth.com/mod/slyde (and LibJF: https://modrinth.com/mod/libjf)

# v1.1.1

Updated to 1.18.2.

Fixes licensing issues, as that is why the pack was off of Modrinth for a while, and why we have removed the previous versions.
