# Sodium Plus

## About

Sodium Plus aims to re-create the experience of the OptiFine mod, while still having the most resource-efficient Minecraft client you can have. It also comes with some visual tweaks, quality-of-life changes, and a couple of bug patches. A couple of these mods (such as Chest Tracker) you may not like, as it changes gameplay, even if it is only client-side. Because of this, I might make a fair play edition later on.

If you would like a CurseForge format version of this modpack, you can get it from our GitHub releases: https://github.com/NoSadBeHappy/sodiumplus/releases

Please submit any bugs or feature requests on out GitHub issues page: https://github.com/NoSadBeHappy/sodiumplus/issues

Note: If you're looking for __OutPerform__, it is no longer maintained. My friend is now helping me work on Sodium Plus, since he no longer works on OutPerform, and Sodium Plus is much better.

Old OutPerform versions can be found here:
