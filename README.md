## About

Sodium Plus aims to re-create the experience of the OptiFine mod, while still having the most performant Minecraft client possible. It also comes with some visual tweaks, quality-of-life changes, and lots of bug fixes.

If you would like a CurseForge format version of this modpack, you can get it from our GitHub releases: https://github.com/NoSadBeHappy/SodiumPlus/releases

Please submit any bugs or feature requests on out GitHub issues page: https://github.com/NoSadBeHappy/SodiumPlus/issues

Note: If you're looking for __OutPerform__, it is no longer maintained. My friend is now helping me work on Sodium Plus, since he no longer works on OutPerform, and Sodium Plus is much better.

Old OutPerform versions can be found here:

If you would like to suggest anything, use out GitHub issues for now: https://github.com/NoSadBeHappy/sodiumplus/issues
