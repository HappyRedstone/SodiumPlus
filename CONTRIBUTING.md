## Packwiz

We use packwiz to manage mods and assets, so please use it for that too! Their docs are here: https://packwiz.infra.link

## Changelogs

To create changelogs, you can run the python script (`changelog.py`) to auto-pull all the latest changelogs from Modrinth, but don't modify the CHANGELOG.md from that. That should be manually created. The script will generate a CHANGELIST.md that you can base that off of, but will not be in the repository for others to see.
